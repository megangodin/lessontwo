            There are <em> good </em> ways and <em>bad</em> ways to write a JavaScript for loop. Lucky for you, I know the <em> good </em> ways.

            Consider this quote from Edsger Dijkstra:
        </div>

        <div id="dijkstra">
            <!--
            Since this is a block of quoted text, wrap it in an HTML blockquote element.
            -->
            <blockquote>
            "There are very different programming styles. I tend to see them as Mozart versus Beethoven. When Mozart started to write,
            the composition was finished. He wrote the manuscript and it was 'aus einem Guss' (from one cast). In beautiful
            handwriting, too. Beethoven was a doubter and a struggler who started writing before he finished the composition
            and then glued corrections onto the page. In one place he did this nine times. When they peeled them, the last
            version proved identical to the first one." - Edsger W. Dijkstra

        <div id="bold-claims">
            <!--
            Emphasize the names "Mozart" and "Beethoven" with the <strong> tag.
            -->
            I may be the only programmer who takes the good from both <strong> Mozart</strong> and <strong> Beethoven</strong> and discards the bad. I'm that good.

            Behold:
        </div>

        <pre id="code">
            <!--
            Since this is JavaScript (code), wrap it in an HTML code element.
            -->           
            <code>for(var i = 0; i < 256; i++) { 
                console.log( "The index is: ", i); 
            }           
        </code>
